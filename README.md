STEPS TO WRITE THE SQL QUERY TO:
Create a stored procedure to get the number of hours between two dates having a DateTime
format. You should exclude all Sundays and 1st and 2nd Saturdays if it comes within the date
range. If either of the input dates are Sunday or the 1st or 2nd Saturday, then include that
particular date too. Stored procedure will have two input parameters - Start_Date and
